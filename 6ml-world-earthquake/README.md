# 6 Magnitude Earthquake

## Overview

This project visualizes global earthquake activity with a magnitude of 6.0 or higher. The data was sourced from an international earthquake research organization (exact source not recorded) and transformed for visualization in Tableau. The resulting interactive map enables exploration of earthquake distribution by location, magnitude, and date.

## Process

### Data Acquisition

Obtained a CSV dataset containing global earthquake records from a research organization’s website.

Dataset included event metadata such as date, time, magnitude, latitude, longitude, and depth.

### Data Transformation

Converted the original CSV file into JSON format to ensure compatibility with Tableau mapping tools.

Verified data integrity (e.g., ensuring coordinate accuracy, consistent magnitude formatting).

### Visualization

Created an interactive map in Tableau displaying earthquake events.

Used color and size encoding to represent magnitude and depth.

Enabled filters for date ranges and geographic regions.

## Tools Used

 * Python – for CSV-to-JSON data conversion and light preprocessing.

 * Tableau – for map visualization and interactive exploration.

## Key Insight

While the primary goal was technical conversion and visualization, the map allows users to quickly identify geographic clusters of seismic activity and analyze patterns in high-magnitude earthquake events worldwide.
