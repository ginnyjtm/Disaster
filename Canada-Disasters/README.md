# Canada Disaster – Agriculture Focus (Phase 1)

## Overview
This project explores how natural disasters in Canada (and in neighboring North America) impact agricultural activities, including crop yields, livestock, and supply chain resilience.  
Using historical disaster records from the **Canada Disaster Database (CDD)** (source to be confirmed), the analysis identifies patterns and vulnerabilities that directly affect Canadian agriculture.  

The ultimate goal is to provide **data-driven insights** that can guide risk mitigation strategies, support farming communities, and improve disaster preparedness in the agricultural sector.

## Objectives
1. **Identify High-Impact Disaster Types**
   - Determine which natural disasters historically cause the greatest agricultural loss in Canada.
   - Compare effects across different provinces and agricultural zones.

2. **Analyze Seasonal Vulnerability**
   - Investigate whether disasters coincide with planting or harvest seasons.
   - Detect shifts in disaster seasonality over time (potential climate change indicators).

3. **Map Regional Crop & Livestock Risks**
   - Highlight provinces or regions where specific crops or livestock are most vulnerable.
   - Assess recovery time for agricultural production after major events.

4. **Assess Supply Chain Weak Points**
   - Identify disaster-prone areas that disrupt food and agricultural product transportation.
   - Explore the ripple effect of U.S. disasters on Canadian agricultural trade.

5. **Develop Preliminary Risk Forecast Models**
   - Use historical patterns to project potential agricultural impacts in the next growing season.

## Data Source
- **Primary Data:** Historical disaster dataset from **CDD** (Canada Disaster Database).
- **Geographic Coverage:** Canada + U.S. agricultural regions with potential cross-border impact.
- **Timeframe:** Multiple years (final time range will be defined after dataset cleaning).

---

## Tools & Methods
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoPandas)
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA), seasonal trend analysis, disaster impact scoring
- **Visualization:** Choropleth maps, seasonal impact heatmaps, time-to-recovery plots
- **Forecasting:** Initial statistical modeling for yield impact prediction

---

## Potential Use Cases
- Government agencies planning disaster relief and agricultural policy.
- Farmers’ associations and cooperatives developing climate resilience strategies.
- Agricultural research centers evaluating long-term climate and disaster risks.

---

## Future Phases
- **Phase 2:** Expand scope to include urban infrastructure and economic impacts.
- **Phase 3:** Integrate satellite imagery and weather forecasts for real-time monitoring.
- **Phase 4:** Build an interactive dashboard for public and policy-maker access.
