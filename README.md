# Disaster
This category features data-driven analyses focused on natural disasters, including wildfires, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other severe weather phenomena. Projects in this section apply exploratory data analysis (EDA), geospatial visualization, and predictive modeling to identify disaster patterns, assess impact, and support emergency preparedness and risk management strategies. These projects demonstrate skills in working with temporal, geospatial, and multi-source environmental datasets.

## Key topics:

* Climate patterns and disaster frequency

* Geographic impact analysis

* Time series forecasting

* Emergency response and risk zones

* Correlation between environmental factors and disaster severity
